# BitOS – A New Era of Operating Systems

**BitOS** is a next-gen experimental operating system built in **Rust**, focused on security, simplicity, and exploration. This is not just an OS; it's an idea — to build a new digital world rooted in freedom, speed, and innovation.

> Current Level: 0  
> Status: Learning, prototyping, and simulating kernel logic


## Vision

BitOS is not a Linux clone. It's a fresh take on what a personal OS can be — spiritual, technical, and deeply personal. Built with:
- **Rust** for memory-safety and performance
- Custom kernel architecture (no `std`)
- Focus on AI integration, custom UI, and minimalist design


## Roadmap

* [x] Level 0: Basic kernel simulation with enums and handlers
* [ ] Level 1: Bare-metal setup (`#![no_std]`, `bootimage`, etc.)
* [ ] Level 2: Memory management and interrupt handling
* [ ] Level 3: Custom shell, UI, and file system
* [ ] Level ∞: BitAI, BitNote, BitLearn, BitDraw, etc. ecosystem
